# Mulisium
Mulisium is a small project that was born at HonestGameJam 2022 whose theme was "explore". It is a short game that tries to explore a museum in which the rooms do not respect the rules of Euclidean spaces. Thanks to the use of portals, it is possible to create pavilions with too many rooms, turn scenes around and place the player on very small places.

Here are all the managers, both the event manager and the input manager and several more that are in charge of managing the rest of the aspects of Mulisium.

#### Miscellaneous
Helper scripts are found here.

#### Portal
In this folder is the script that manages how the portal works and the special shader that is used to cut out the portal's auxiliary camera so that only what the player should see is visible to create the illusion of continuity.
