# Graph Based Dialog System

This package has been made from scratch by me. It is an interface that allows you to write and save dialogues with the possibility of branching so that you can later implement them in games in a more comfortable way. It has a viewport to make your handling more comfortable.

### Content
These are the folders you will find in this repository.

- Editor
In this folder are all the scripts that make up the graph itself, including the Node class, and the viewport where you can edit everything without having to touch code.

- Runtime
Here are all the package functions , the connections between nodes, and the nodes data in the graph.
