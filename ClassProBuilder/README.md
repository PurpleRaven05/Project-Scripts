# ClassPro Builder

ClassPro Builder is an application developed in Android Studio using the MVP (Model View Presenter) model. It is an application designed so that school and high school teachers can manage their students' grades without having to resort to Excel, allowing them to configure the weightings of the subjects to their liking, manage the grade out of 10 of each weighting individually for each student and take the list of the average mark of the student in each subject or of all the students in a specific subject.
